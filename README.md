# Talk: Visual Chat Story Editor

**Talk** is a vibe-coded (Vscode/GPT4.1), fully functional, user-friendly visual chat story editor for writers, and roleplayers. It allows you to create, edit, and export chat-based stories with rich formatting, character management, media attachments, and advanced AI integration for generating dialogue.

---

**IMPORTANT:** A fully functional "Packaged for Production" stripped down version is available here too. Just download the small-sized folder "Dist", uzip it, and run the "Talk_Dist" batch file (no installation or pre-requisites required). If you want to use the LLM with it, run Koboldcpp loading your preferred model there. Ensure Koboldcpp's port is 5001.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

### Node.js & npm
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Required npm Packages
- `vue@3` (Vue.js 3)
- `vue3-colorpicker`
- `mammoth` (for `.docx` import)
- `docx` (for `.docx` export)

### LLM Backend (Optional, for AI features)
- A compatible LLM backend server (e.g., OpenAI-compatible API, or your own local LLM server).
- Default backend URL is `http://localhost:3000/generate` (configurable in code).

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository to any place your disk.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ialhabbal/Talk.git
cd Talk
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

```sh
npm run dev
```

- The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as indicated in your terminal).

### 4. (Optional) Set Up LLM Backend

- For AI message generation, you need a backend server that accepts POST requests at `/generate`.
- By default, the app expects the backend at `http://localhost:3000/generate`.
- You can change this URL in the `backendUrl` variable in [src/App.vue](src/App.vue).
- I tested with Koboldcpp on it's port 5001.

## Usage Guide

### Starting a New Chat

1. **Add Characters/Users**: Click "Add New Character" or "Add New User" and enter a name.
2. **Customize**: Click the avatar to upload a portrait, and adjust font/color settings as desired.
3. **Add Messages**: Use the "+" button next to a character to add a message, or click avatars inline to insert messages anywhere.
4. **Edit Messages**: Click any message to edit. Press Enter to save.

### Importing Existing Chats

- Click "Load Existing Chat File" and select a `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.json` file.
- For `.txt`/`.docx`, select detected characters and click "Add Characters to Chat".
  *note* In my testing: You can import .txt chats exported from SillyTavern and add characters and users but the LLM won't differentiate between them. However creating, saving/export, re-importing chats with this program doesn't have this issue.

### Exporting Chats

- Use the export buttons in the sidebar to save your chat as HTML, TXT, DOCX, or JSON.

### Customizing Layout & Theme

- Use the "Theme" dropdown to switch themes.
- Adjust sliders for message width, font size, portrait size/shape, and blur.
- Pick custom colors for text, quotes, and names.

### Attaching & Managing Media

- Click the paperclip üìé on a message to attach an image or video.
- Use the resize handles to adjust media size.
- Detach media for floating previews, drag to move, and pin back to messages.

### Setting Chat Background

- Click "Set Chat Background" to upload an image.
- Remove or change the background at any time.

### Using AI/LLM Features

1. **Configure LLM Presets**: Fill out the LLM Preset section in the sidebar.
2. **Export/Import Presets**: Use the ‚¨ÜÔ∏è/‚¨áÔ∏è buttons to save/load your settings.
3. **Generate Messages**: Click the ü§ñ button next to a character to generate a message using the LLM.
4. **Streaming**: Watch messages appear in real-time if streaming is enabled.
5. **Retry/Stop/Version**: Use üîÅ to retry, ‚èπÔ∏è to stop, and ‚¨ÖÔ∏è/‚û°Ô∏è to navigate message versions.
